Furthermore, thanks to hosting, the host country can boost its economy in the service industry, strengthening relationships between countries. On the other hand, the presence of too many people from other countries can cause a significant increase in disorderly behavior and the host country may be susceptible to the spread of disease from other countries.

I need to go from my home to my school and reverse on my motorbike. I mean, I drive to school by myself for almost every weekdays, from Monday to Saturday. And this road is an only one way to approach my school so I can't choose anyone else. There are several reasons why I hate it. The first one is this road is located in the outskirt of my hometown. So It consists of a range of vans cars and sometimes containers and I'm afraid that there will be a sudden accident. Secondly, there is a repetitive task in the same roaad for my three high school years. So it's kinda boring and tedious to me. The last reason is about the weather. In the summer, because this year, my scheduled study is in the afternoon. So I need to get out of my apartment at, half past twelve and in the summer, at this time, in the peak of heat, the weather is scorching. If I go out without sun shirt, sun protection shirt, I can caught sunburned. And in the winter, it's the hardest weather to me. I always drive with my naked hands, so so I feel like it's freezing my hand anyway. I wish that my dad could drive me to school by his car.",

We had so much fun, and we learn from each other a lot. The teachers were friendly, patient and kind, they taught us a lot about how to become a good person right now. The school was my first time for everything. It is more about the people than the actual place. We are so grateful for leaving footprints at every corner there.

Over the years, I observed the functioning of different jobs and tried to find what interested me. Now, I might know the answer to this question is to become an interpreter. I derived inspiration for taking this role because of some movies I have seen on TV, at first I just thought on impulse since I was engrossed in the appearance and idiosyncrasy of the interpreters. However, as I grew up, I gradually found out I was attracted by how this job operates, but only about its outer. According to my search, interpreters interpret verbal communication from one language to another. Acting as mediums where language barriers exist, at times, interpreters translate written communication from one language to another. These people work in various fields such as education, healthcare, insurance, legal and other industries. As changeable a person as I am, I always find a job that can offer flexibility. It's not just sitting with an air conditioner turning on and being wrapped up in papers. Therefore, interpreter is a nice option. As I hold a belief it will allow me to discover this whole wide world. On the other hand, we are now living in a modern world, right? This means economic relations with foreign countries are increasing exponentially. That's why knowing some languages inside out, in some ways helps me to have a brighter future.",

Last year, we planned to visit the stunning coastal city of Nha Trang in Vietnam and we decided to cover this quite long distance by car. This was in July, and we set off on our journey early in the morning, excited to explore the beauty of Nha Trang. It was an essential journey for us because all family members usually remain busy with our work most of the time. Only in July, everyone got some free time to enjoy themselves properly with family members, so we didn’t want to miss the opportunity to spend that precious time together. We expected to arrive at around 11 a.m, just at lunch time and enjoyed a meal at one of the well-known seafood restaurants nearby. Suddenly! Our car stopped working 30 km away from our destination. Even though my father had proper knowledge about how to handle a car breakdown, that day, it was really hard for him to find the problem. At last, he googled and luckily there was a repair shop nearby, so we decided to call their emergency number for help. As a result, after 2 hours to solve the issue, we finally reached our destination. Generally, with picturesque landscapes, lush greenery along the way, and specialties, we all were happy that day even after our journey was delayed.",

Not only did she perform well in history - but she also did re but she also did brilliantly at other subjects such as math or English because of her intellectual abilities. I feel - I think like she is really outstanding good. She is adept  good at everything and she is was also a - queer companion - during my tax degree school in town. Thanks to her Things to her husband's guidance, I finally managed to get better grades in history as well. And, yeah, I really hope to see her you again in the future, and that's all I want to share.

I thought she was smart as I have read an interview said that when she was small, she got straight A in almost every exam she took a school.

When I was reading some newspapers online, I came across a title title talking about him and his house. At that time, it was just a small flat. And, from what I read, it just totally freeze me and amaze me a lot. I mean, I was totally captivated by his devotion to what he he did. He used to be a barista in France and moved to Vietnam with his Vietnamese wife. And he hated when he saw the way animals in Vietnam such as cats or dogs are treated unfairly. He's a generous person and an animal lover who has a deep compassion on them and has a strong belief on animal welfare. So he has rescued their life and treat them with great care. I really admire him because he has a great dedication to take care of all the sick animals and the animals that are abandoned and he has spent his whole life moving many places just to buy the best place for for his animals. Even though his neighbor didn't like him, but I think that he did a great job for the community and for Vietnam.",

Studying literature enables us to see the world through the eyes of others, to experience different kinds of emotions, help us perceive the truth and deal with the complexities of life in creative ways. Not only her excellence in profession but also her lifestyles inspired me a lot. My friend told me that she used to undergo many surgeries due to her illness.

I distinctly remember that on that day, the weather was actually bad, however, it totally did not impact negatively my mood. Although black clouds covered the whole sky outside, I still told mum to take me to school early because I didn't want to be late on the first day of school. On the road to school. I had butterflies in my stomach because I worried that I wouldn't be able to make friends with anyone and would have difficulties in adapting to a new class as well as teacher. Luckily, at the first step into the school gate, I met some old friends who studied with me at kindergarten. Honestly, they saved me from terrible anxiety. After that, I sat in the class to wait for teacher. Contrary to my fearfulness, my teacher and classmates were very kind and hilarious. Although it was rainning cats and dogs, being surrounded by may people who are adorable is literally a part I enjoy the most about the first day at school. In short, when I recall old memory, I still found the first at primary school was a memorable experience in my life.",

That was To he, a traditional toy originated from Xuan La village, which was a traditional craft village located only around 40 km from Hanoi centre. As I can recall, my father gave it to me after his business trip to Hanoi. I can vividly remember that To he had the shape of an animal or a fruit. It was made from a special type of rice powder with some natural colors so it was edible. The skilled craftsmen need a mixture which was easily to knead into various eye-catching shapes and stick stuck on bamboo stick. The reason why I think that To he was a special toy is that I live in the central of Vietnam and that was the first time I had seen that kind of toy. It was only ubiquitous in the North and was sold only on two special occasions: Tet holiday and Mid-autumn festival. To he was really a cultural ambassador which let me know more the beauty of Vietnam culture.",

This market existed for hundreds of years, and it is located in the Hanoi Old Quarter area. Besides, it is about 800 meters from Hoan Kiem Lake, quite close to Hang Ma Street and Long Bien station. All of those locations attract many tourists, so I think it is unique to this market. Dong Xuan market is also unique in the low price of goods but still good quality, so a lot of people go here every day. I think no one can leave this place in disappointment. In addition, it attracts part of young people to come here to buy clothing, and shoes, and see some fashion accessories stores. Because I am also a young person, I want to go to this market to buy some clothes at a much cheaper price than some shops and try some famous food here.
