        "answer": "Learning new skills can always be helpful in order to become a successful person in life. I have also learned a few skills in my life, and I would love to talk about one of them. The skill that I wanna mention is time management skill. Although it is a soft skill that people must have, I do think that many youngsters, thesedays, don't use or master it properly. Essential as it is, but when I was younger, i didn't know anything about this useful skill. Till one day, I was burn out because of the work at the club and tons of homework for the high school. Luckily, when I was down in the dumps, my mother was by my side and taught me about this useful skill. Back in that day, I used to note down the work and set up amount of time to handle that. To be honest, it quite hard to write everything, since I was a forgetful person. After a few week, I could handle every task tasks at school, even my score turned out to be better that day. Since the day that I mastered master that skill, my life has turned is like turning over a new leaf to a new page. And now I'm pleased with what I have achieved. This skill not only keeps people from burnout status but also practice us to have more discipline in work. I know that there are many people assumed to be a procrastinators and they will easily be stressful stress by the volumn of work if they don't deal with it sooner. Another positive result that I have seen is having more quality time with friends or beloved family. Or even I can create me-time to recharge my energy after a long day of hard work Anyway I think that this skill is very useful, mainly because it help my a lot and improve quality of life. In that case, my advice is mastering it at all cost and seeing the differences"

        "question": "Describe a short trip you often take but do not like",
        "answer": "Back when I was still in secondary school, every weekend I had to take a small journey to my grandpa's house. My grandpa lived alone and since my parents were busy the whole week at work, I was forced to go visit him. I helped him with domestic chores like going for groceries, gardening and cleaning his house. We gonna have lunch together, I used to go shopping for food and then cook his meal for the entire day. Sometimes, we hang out in the park and I help him visit the doctor and take his pills. I really love spending time with him. Though the destination was totally worth it, I am not really enjoying the journey at all. His house was about 30km away from where I live, so every Sunday, at 6:30 in the morning I had to be at the bus station to catch a ride. It took 1 hour to get to his house. It would not be so bad if it was not so bumpy. The road was crowded and the bus stopped frequently, it was also packed with people. It's not comfortable at all, especially in the morning. I had to sit still for 1 hour and the scenery wasn't helped lift my mood any little bit, just bustling road and tedious buildings, it was a really tiring trip for me. Now my grandpa had moved in to live with my family and I had got to high school, far from home, I don't get the chance to take that trip anymore, though I miss the tranquillity of the neighbourhood, I would not like to experience it again."

        "answer": "Today, the person I want to talk about is none other than my best friend - Phong, who is the smartest person I've ever known. Back in high school, when we first met, we hit it off right away as we shared the same interest in English. But when it came to Math, everything turned out to be completely different. When I was struggling to remember the new formulas, he seemed to have a good head for it. He often stood \ufb01rst in all of the exams and usually completed the classwork in amazing time. I remembered one time, he finished the hardest math question within 5 minutes, while we had to spend the whole lesson trying to figure out the answer. Not only did he perform well in Math, but he was also good at other science subjects because of his intellectual ability. however, the reason why I made friends with him is not because of his intelligence, but his personality. he is very open and often helps people, including me, in study and life. and I am so grateful for having such a great companion like him during high school. Although now we are in a different schools, we still keep in touch and text each other frequently."

That sounds to be weird but I don't recall exactly the time we started to be close with each other. However, I rather ensure that she enthusiastically supported me in my studying process, especially in mathematics. She not only used to give the best solution for various different questions, but also explained reasonably whenever I asked her for assistance. At the present, Hazel is studying an economics major which offers a lot of challenging subjects and harsh requirements for researching. Despite the intense studying environment, she gained first level scholarships each semester, which makes me honestly admire her. What really strikes me the most is the way she manages finances, with the low-income from part time job, she can pay for almost basic demand rather than asking for a parents allowance."

For example, an intelligent farmer can change the cultivation, farming techniques to be suitable with plants and weather conditions  instead of having no creativity. This leads to the amount number of agricultural produce to be definitely high, which means that more revenue he can gain. And I suppose that the abundant products after harvest is successful."

As far as I am concerned, this construction is by far the second highest tower in Hanoi, with 65 floors in total. What sets it apart from the others is probably its one-of-a-kind design. Inspired by Vietnamese traditional costume, Lotte Tower has a shape that pretty much resembles the curves of ao dai, which makes it unmistakable in a city full of skyscrapers like Hanoi. Most notably, there is an observation deck located on the 65th floor. It provides us with a panoramic view of the city with a stunning skyline, helping us capture all the beauties of Hanoi into our eyesight. I could give you, like, tons of reasons why I adore this magnificent building. Whenever I feel drained, I feel like riding the elevator to the observation deck to enjoy stunning, unrestricted views of the capital, which would make me feel mentally better."

A few months ago, on a crowded bus in Hanoi, I helped a pregnant woman carry very heavy things to her house. Since your house is on a high floor but there is no elevator, I asked you cordially if I could help carry things up the stairs. When I gave the things back to the woman and she instinctively said 'thank you very much'. I think she was happy to have someone help her down the stairs when she thanked me deeply a few more times. To be honest, I really felt elated and a joy filled me. I only feel this great feeling when I've actually achieved something extraordinary - I believe that being able to support someone in some way is a great achievement."

Let me talk about one such local news that I came across in the local newspaper last week which was about the construction of a park for the local residents.  After watching this new, my family as well as my neighbors were really happy Actually, in my town there was no park however there was a abandoned area that people used to leave litter. At the same time, you can see mosquitoes and flies here all the time. This place not only stinks but also spreads diseases. But the council decided to turn it into a public park. It would definitely help to make the town clean and green. In addition, it would allow the community members to socialize as we see in the evening as well in the morning time, people liked visiting parks, where they sit together and talk. It would be a wonderful place for old people to sit together to play cards, gossip and enjoy other activities. Similarly, it would also provide a safe playing area for children. In my area, most children play on the streets which are quite dangerous as there is always a risk of accidents. But, a park would offer them a safer place, where they can play. Last but not least, people these days suffer from many health concerns but in the park, they can go for a walk and practice yoga which really benefit the people and would ensure well- being of the community members. So, this is the piece of local news that was exciting for the local people"

And besides, when I come back home from the library, once more time, I have to suffer from... you know, kind of... the traffic congestion, and it's really a real pain in the neck for me. But I have no choice because it's a demand of my faculty for every students to produce at least 3 essays for every single of course at the university. So yeah... I have no choice but have to accept it and try to go for it. But I must say, in some perspectives, it kind of worth for me to suffer from all that discomforts because, you know... Thanks to this trip in order to reach the library, I have a chance to get reach to valuable and valuable documents that would serve for my academic performance and I hope that it's also useful for my academic pursuit in the future."

        "answer": "Today I'm going to talk about a sport which I like most. I am a big fan of boxing. I have taken up this sport since I was a little girl, my brother instructed me about this sport and I was attracted. Boxing is not a easy game, it requires players who have a good strength and quick reflexes. One competition will be performed when there are 2 players and it is occured with boxing ring in small court. In terms of how it plays, it has 3 stages. At the beginning time, 2 boxers will greet to each other and arbitration will start this competition then. Player will fight against his\/her enermy until he\/she fall out and can't get up. I would say boxing is a great sport to develop strength, and it's really entertaining. Although boxing is also a dangerous sport, boxing helps me to relax and relieve stress after a long week of studies. I believe that it is an interesting and sport worth trying"

Looking from the outside, there was a big blue gate with the school's name above it. Near the gate, there was a parking are where the students and teachers left vehicles before entering the building. I can vividly remember that my old school had a library, a computer laboratory, and a big playground with flowering plants. That was my favorite place because it was a leafy area which can gave me shadow to read comic books during breaktime. The primary school was the place where I learnt how to read and write and had many friends with full of memories. And if I have some times on my hand I would definitely go back to this place to see how it has changed over time."

I\u2019ve always had much admiration for Bill Gates, who was the founder and CEO of Microsoft. He is also  internationally acclaimed as one of the best known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. I still  remember vividly that I was so impressed by his quote in my textbook - \u201cIF YOU ARE BORN POOR, IT\u2019S NOT YOUR MISTAKE. BUT IF YOU DIE POOR, IT\u2019S YOUR MISTAKE\u201d. It really motivates people how to make the most of their life and overcomes adversities in life. As time goes by, I have been able to understand him better through several video clips which he appeared on Tedtalk. I call him intelligent because he has huge knowledge about his field. The one thing about him that has inspired me a lot is that he cares about equality and human rights and provided a comfortable working environment for his staff during his time at Microsoft. He is doing everything he can for the whole world, not just America. As for me, he is my role model, and I wish that one day I could be as smart as him"

        "answer": "I am going to talk about the Bluetooth AirPods 2 that my elder sister gave me when I passed the high school entrance exam with flying colors. As I can recall, it was on Sunday, and my sister didn\u2019t have to go to work, so she took me to the Cellphone S store where many technological gadgets available there were on sale. As we had discussed what to buy before, my sister bought me one on the spot. At first, it wasn\u2019t that straightforward to use so I had to get my sister to operate it for me. I was blissfully happy to own this device. It was actually two wireless Bluetooth earbuds put in a white plastic case and looked so fancy. It was light and fit perfectly in my palm so I could easily carry it anywhere. In order to keep the AirPods carefully, I bought a Corgi-shaped case to cover it and that was so cute. I have been using it on a daily basis since then and it has done wonders for my English listening skills. I\u2019ve often used it to listen to an English podcast episode before bedtime and the sound was very clear. Also, after school, I put my earbuds on and listen to music while doing the cleaning or when I go jogging in the afternoon. Perhaps thanks to this useful device, I can improve my concentration when listening without being distracted so I really appreciate this gift my sister gave me. Were I to be more financially viable, I would definitely switch to Airpods pro to enhance my experiences."

For the young generation, especially children, are more likely to be distracted from studying because they don\u2019t have the habit of putting restrictions on the amount of time spent on screen. Another reason for this is that it\u2019s been scientifically proven that overuse of the Internet such as social media can be the catalyst for extreme anxiety. That\u2019s why I think it is important for us to cut down on the amount of time using technology."

        "question": "Which programs or apps are most popular in your country?",
        "answer": "I believe that there is an ever-widening circle of young adults in Vietnam using social media applications, especially teenagers. It is a norm that such people have a Facebook or Instagram account and often spend several hours per day surfing the newsfeed. I think this is because they can watch reels or chat with their friends or join study groups. However, Vietnamese older people prefer using apps to read online newspapers or video calls with their offspring and grandchildren. And I\u2019m quite sure they even use these features more smoothly than some adults."

        "answer": "Definitely yes. I suppose that it is extremely necessary for parents to put restrictions on the amount of time their kids spend on mobile phones every day. In fact, young children are quite indifferent to the importance of managing screen time and will be more likely to get addicted, so parents should control their time on mobile phone apps to avoid them being distracted from studying. Furthermore, I highly recommend that parents should also patiently explain to their kids about the drawbacks of prolonged screen exposure so they would willingly listen to what they say."

        "answer": "I know many brilliant people around me but today I am going to talk about my friend, his name is Minh Duc. Duc is my classmate at CVA high school and also one of my bestfriend. I decided to choose him because Duc was the top-notch student valedictorian in my specialized class who had the highest grades in the Entrance Exam. He is really smart. I admired him since Duc is quick on the uptake, he can understand the lecture easily and also answer all teacher's question quickly. I have to say that he is a truly genius as Duc can pass any exams despite his laziness. I still remember the time that we prepared for the final test, he just slept in almost lessons. But finally his score was a 9.5 at Math. I had no idea how he could review all the notes knowledge in one night. Duc is not only smart but also very independent and mature because he thinks logical and does everything with a plan. Furthermore he has a number of soft skills, his communication and teamwork skills are quite good because whenever my class have to work in group Duc can support each member and give them some useful advice advices.  In conclusion, Duc is well-educated and smart so I think he is a role model for many students in general."

But to work as a financial analyst, much more focused study will be needed. You will have to analyse the data, look through the income statement and balance sheet to check the financial health of a company. To me, it is an attractive job because of 2 main reasons. First, it is a job that can stimulate the brain. Because of its difficulty, a financial analyst must devote a great deal of time and effort to get the job done and become an expertise in the industry. Second, to compensate the hard work, a rewarding income is usually to be expected. And so overall, I think that to work as a financial analyst will give me prospective career opportunities."

My university has four buildings, one in district 12, which is really far from my house, but I have to study some subjects at that campus. Therefore, from Monday to Friday, I have to travel to school by bus and it takes around one hour to reach the destination. Sometimes, due to the traffic congestion, it takes much more time to arrive, so there were some days that I was late for classes. To be honest, before entering the school, I didn't know that I had to travel to the campus this frequently.  That being said, I do not truly regret for choosing the university because it is has known for its excellent in media courses. Also, I had positive reviews from my cousins about the outstanding lecturers. Turning back to the main topic, one more reason that make me dislike the trip to school is that I have to wake up early to catch the first bus so that I can be on time for the 7:00am class. I find my daily schedule very hectic. I feel exhausted at the end of the day as I reach home by travelling again in the rush hours. Moreover, I am not able to devote time for leisure activities and I personally think it is a  waste of time to lose an  interval of two hours everyday just to commute to school."

One time when I participated in a competition in my school, I had an argument with my teammates and we hardly reconciled with each other. My mom told me about negotiation in order to help me to find common voice. And then I negotiate with my friends to make a good decision so we got the first prize. In order to master this skill, I need have to a  good communication skill and frequent practice. Sometimes, I go to market with my mom to bargain with sellers so as to get a reasonable price or in my class, we have many debates so I think they are really good chances for me to improve negotiation skill. I suppose that this crucial skill is very useful for me in the future. For example, when I apply for a job, if I have a high education and necessary skills, I could negotiate with employers to get a well-paid salary."

In my country,  being a teacher is a very well-respected job so everyone looks up to people like them. Also, one of the positives about teaching job is that it teaches us value beyond the knowledge that they impart. In deed without teachers we would all be ignorant. However, undoubtedly, a teaching job is really challenging. The first reason is that it offers a high education such as a degree in a university or a college or some certificates in various majors as well as practical skills especially pedagogical skill. In terms of working time, you can work with people all the time. In fact it is simplistic for teachers to interact with people including students, students' parents or colleague. It needs a lot of time to work at educational institutions or at home like correcting students' essays or giving the feedback or sth like that. Anyway, being a teacher is a tiring and stressful job yet it is a rewarding career that I wanna pursue. There are no more people choose this job so I'm always grateful to teachers who dedicate their effort to teach young generations."

And we\u2019ve been friends ever since I was a freshman at university, because I found myself sitting next to him in our first lecture, and we soon got on like a house on fire. As for what kind of person he is. I guess the best way to describe him would be sociable and likeable. Although he\u2019s a super smart guy, he\u2019s not arrogant in the slightest, and he gets on well with pretty much everyone in my year. Therefore, he always becomes the life and soul of a party. Anyway, moving onto why I think he\u2019s intelligent, well first of all, he always pass all our exams with flying colours, you know, like coming top or second in most of them. And what\u2019s amazing is that he doesn\u2019t seem to be a studious person, but still manages to do so well. For example, as well as studying, he\u2019s also got a part-time job, which I\u2019m sure must take up quite a bit of his time, so it\u2019s really impressive how he\u2019s able to do this without it affecting his studies whatsoever.

The first thing to mention is going to the Tet market. adults buy new clothes for children and buy candies and fruits to decorate Tet. We are in the north, so we have a typical flower that is peach or kumquat. Students and workers are entitled to 7 days off. This is the time when people who are far away return to their families.

We attended the same primary school, are benchmates in terms of time, and it didn't take us a donkey's worth of years to become lifelong friends. Friends, we are all of one mind. After ten years, he decided to pursue a career in science, as opposed to commerce and travel. He and I got along well; in fact, there are good reasons why we lived in the same colony and spent so much time together. He is a helpful person who was an excellent teacher and was always willing to lend a hand to classmates when they needed it.Since he picks things up more quickly than other people, he falls under the intelligence category. I clearly recall that before his assistance, I struggled with math. He is the main cause  of my current aptitude for math problem-solving.His  academic performance was strong, and if my memory serves me well, he consistently placed first or second. He was also an expert at physical exertion. He once took part in state-level chess competitions and won silver. With his cleverness, he may influence people's emotions, for example, by delivering jokes to depressed individuals.He recently took the IELTS and received an 8, and he will relocate to Canada to continue his studies."

I strongly believe that climate change is mainly affected by human activities. For example, people usually burn many trashes or disposable products like bottles of water, plastic straws, rubber ball bags,..... The consequences is that many fumes like carbon dioxide are realeased and they trapped to ozone layer of the Earth.Besides, humans also cut down a lot of trees and use more harmful chemicals to produce many th\u00ecngs. What we can act to protect the Earth's environment? In terms of the governments, they need to ban all illegal littering into the environment by all factories and stations. Moreover, althorities should encourage residents to protect the environment by raising residents' resident's awareness, switch product by plastic to product by eco-friendly materials,... In terms of dwellers's attitudes, they should change the ways their lives, stop releasing greenhouse gases and ready for what cllimate change will bring. With respect to my individual, I should adapt 3R principle to my daily lives and remind everyone around me about protecting the environment."

The rules of basketball are quite strict. When playing in a team, the sense of responsibility of each individual is extremely important. I've been playing basketball since I was in first grade. When I play it,I just need to buy a ball and a good pair of shoes. I often play with my best friends, my teammates or my dad. My dad is the one who inspires me to play basketball. He plays it very well. I usually play basketball twice a week, on Wednesday and Sunday. I can play basketball in the school yard or in my back garden. The benefits of basketball practice are also great calorie burning, practice teamwork skills, directing and arranging to suit situations. Although playing basketball will make me tall but I am still very short. I like playing basketball because it makes my health better and I can make many new friends while competing. Basketball also makes me feel happy after a tiring day of studying."

        "answer": "A short trip that i frequently take is a trip to my grandparent's home. I love to visit my grandparents, but i dislike the journey and its activities. Basically this trip is mixed feeling to me.  I go to Da Nang city, which is almost 900 kilometers away from Ho Chi Minh city where i live. I often go there every special festival with my parents ,especially holidays. It normally take us 8 hours to drive there by car. To be honest it's so horrible to me because i usually get carsick and i hate everytime we have to wait to move forward when its traffic jams which caused by the dense street. I also have headache through the journey.  Therefore i would rather fall asleep than stay awake to talk. As i remember, i cant sleep at my grandparents house there as i am habituated to sleep on my bed. the fact that these trips is very tiring and stressful to me.  i can't even have a mood to play games nor listen to music due to my carsickness and headache.  However i love to see my grandparents a lot.  Everytime i visit them i feel all my uncomfortable feelings throughout the tedious trip just gone. My grandparents also really loves me, we share a lot of things in life and i help my grandparents do chores everyday i live there. Moreover I love watching their house from far away which is set against the backdrop of beautiful beaches and high mountains. I want to be with them but i do not like the experience of going there then coming back. "

        "answer": "The beach seems to me a paradise of endless fun and discoveries. There are many things that I can do at the beach such as building sand castles, volleyball, etc. But there is one very interesting activity that I have always wanted to try until now. That is scuba diving and watching corals and sea creatures. To prepare for this activity you will need a diving suit, swimming goggles, and an oxygen tank and snorkel as you will be diving very deep compared to the shore. Because this activity is quite dangerous, you should find yourself an expert to guide you. This activity has attracted quite a bit of attention because of the attraction of deep-sea diving and its diversity. When diving, you can see fishes swimming or discover underwater plants that you have never seen before. For example, watching corals, if you are lucky you will be able to catch some clownfish because this is their natural habitat. This activity is extremely attractive because it not only brings us joy, but it also helps us open our minds and witness with our own eyes the aquatic species that we have only seen on TV before."

It's a coincidence why I have known this job. 2 years ago, I had a chance to talk with my grandfather, he told me a lot information about a police's work which was his dream that he couldn't attain. Since then, I have paid my preference for this job. As you know, a police wok is not a glamorous one. It is their responsibility to prevent people from dangerous places. Besides, whenever people have their own difficulties, they always land a hand to them. Especially, they have to spend most of their time to dedicate themselves to their people, their country. Recently, I have read news that they had rescued sucessfully a 5 year old boy hostage. They must have been careful and extremely concientious. The more information I know about this job, the more respect I pay to the police. Now, I am at pains of studying to achieve my ambition. Although I know that it is not an easy dream for me to attain it, I always try my best whenever I can."

        "answer": "Today, I would like to talk about swimming - one of my favorite activities on the beach. Last summer, I had a chance to visit PhuQuoc Island which had many crystal clear beaches to escape the heat of the scorching summer in HaNoi. When I was 15 years old, I learned how to swim and it took me three weeks to get used to the water because I was afraid of swimming before. My swimming style is breaststroke and sometimes combined with crawl. I usually warm up with a few simple movements before entering the water to avoid cramps. Beside swim suit, swimming goggles and life jacket are indispensable when I go swimming in the sea to prevent accidents such as cramps, drowning or even rough water. There are many reasons why I love swimming and the first one is that I can blow off steam and boost my mood after a hard working time. Secondly, it has some physical benefits such as building muscle strength, maintaining a healthy weight and so on. Lastly, swimming can improve a good sleep quality as exercise helps reset my body\u2019s internal clock so that I can easy to fall into deep sleep."

In physically, it allow people to have a healthier body and also help them to overcome fears in psycologically so that a higher level of self-confidence is boosted.

I distinctly remember that on that day, the weather was actually bad, however, it totally did not impact negatively my mood. Although black clouds covered the whole sky outside, I still told mum to take me to school early because I didn't want to be late on the first day of school. On the road to school. I had butterflies in my stomach because I worried that I wouldn't be able to make friends with anyone and would have difficulties in adapting to a new class as well as teacher. Luckily, at the first step into the school gate, I met some old friends who studied with me at kindergarten. Honestly, they saved me from terrible anxiety. After that, I sat in the class to wait for teacher. Contrary to my fearfulness, my teacher and classmates were very kind and hilarious. Although it was rainning cats and dogs, being surrounded by may people who are adorable is literally a part I enjoy the most about the first day at school. In short, when I recall old memory, I still found the first at primary school was a memorable experience in my life."

He's a member of Vingroup, the most well-established organization in Viet Nam and as I remember,.  He's working in the real-estate segment. The reason I think he is intelligent is because he is able to analyze the real-estate trend and communicate well with his customers. His customers are most of the time foreigners, so his English must be really well in order to negotiate and sell property to them. Working in such company must be very competitive and under lots of pressure, but he can still manage to get through that. And to be honest, I have admired him since I was a primary school pupil. I always promise my self to become the second version of him."

        "answer": "Honestly, my hobby is seeking information about famous people in the world in order to learn from them. After reading details of intelligent people such as Elon Musk, Tim Cook and so on, I have an impression most on Uncle Ho. He is well known for struggling against wars and dedicated his life to help Vietnam emancipate  (x\u00f3a) from rivals. On top of that, Vietnamese people pay a lot of respect to him because he is a kind of person who always put others before himself and shouldered not only his own burdens and others as well. He used to say a sentence that makes me remember until now, which is is that he had only a dream in his life that every Vietnamese people lead a happy life. All in all, the important thing that makes him become a political mandate is the strategy he chose for Vietnam fighting. In 1900s, there was a tidal wave of distringuished people in Vietnam, all of who had a wish to help Vietnam become liberal. However, the way they chose for fighting was probably wrong. For example, Phan Boi Chau wanted to receive help from Japan while Ho Chi Minh followed communism and wanted to fight by Vietnamese strength. Now, I have seen Ho Chi Minh as a prime example to follow."

When we saw this happening, we decided to raise money to buy books and learning materials for the little ones. After that, we got on a bus to Ha Giang to help the children.

This is my favorite sport. This game requires at least two players, or maybe more. Unlike football, badminton does not need too many players and a large space. It only needs a small campus that can be played back and forth and some necessary equipment such as badminton rackets, shuttlecocks, nets, and a marked court. Players will take turns hitting the ball so that it crosses the net until it falls to the ground on the opponent's court to score. Although you may find it extremely easy and simple, this sport is not. It takes a lot of handling skills and body flexibility. Children to the elderly can play this sport to exercise health, flexibility, and entertainment. I often play badminton on weekends for fun, and at the same time, I feel more comfortable after a tiring week of studying. You should try this sport, I am sure it will help you relax and have fun after a stress day of work and study."

For example, if students were facing problems in studying or personal life, she would spend time on having private conversations with them, shared useful advice and gave physical or spiritual support. What struck me most is the way she taught us in class, the beauty and meaning of every literary works were explained and delivered by her clear and mellifluous voice. Besides, because of her love which was spread throughout her lessons, I realized the importance of this subject. Studying literature enables us to see the world through the eyes of others, to experience different kinds of emotions, help us perceive the truth and deal with the complexities of life in creative ways. Not only her excellence in profession but also her lifestyles inspired me a lot. My friend told me that she used to undergo many surgeries due to her illness. However, she did not even talk about it one time. She always express the most positive and optimistic attitude towards difficulties. Although it has been a long time since the day I graduated from high school, what she said and did for me still living in my heart."

This match happened about 2 years ago, it was a competition between Vietnam and Saudi Arabia team and it was considered to be one of the most unforgettable matches for Vietnamese people. Because this match was held in Chang Zhou in the winter so the weather during this time was very cold for us; in other words, this match may seem to be difficult. To be honest, because it is the first time Vietnam team went to final round in this sport event, so all the residents in Vietnam were extremely looking forward to it, we hoped that our football team could win and become a legend through this match. And as we expected, our team had a brilliant performance in this competition. To illustrate, I was very impressed by a defender called Doan Van Hau who could excellently steal the ball from the opponents. In addition to this, some midfielders also had some great combination that they were able to pass the ball correctly to their teammates. Moreover, thanks to a Korean coach called Park Hangseo who created training sessions a very well trained curriculum to football team, they still played very well in spite of the harsh weather condition. Although our team cannot win this match, they successfully left an impression on to the opponent as well as to Vietnamese people, we were very proud of them. Therefore, after that, all football players in this team were given many a plethora of prizes thanks to their effort such as a huge amount of money, motorcycles even houses."

I bought it from a friend so it was affordability. This Candy Bong Z is an upgrade version from the previous one which is Candy Bong. The outward design has changed a lot of the first version to the latest one. Instead of a lollipop like Candy Bong, it incorporates a black round middle with a glowing ring around it and the handle is now silver. Honestly, I really love the newest design because it looks so lovely and is definitely more convenient to carry. The lightstick can change into each member's colour and it can work in three modes: on, flicker and dimming. The lightstick is utilized for the purpose of cheering the group in their performances or concerts. Actually, I also used it at some parties. I felt extremely pleased about it because I have been their huge fan since 2017 and I purchased it with all of my savings money. It felt so satisfying when you have been a huge fan for a long time and now have an official lightstick in your K-pop merch collection. Although I haven't had a chance to attend their concerts, I hope someday I could see them in real life with my Candy Bong Z."

When I\u2019m a ninth grader, the Covid-19 happened. My parents bought a laptop for me to use for online learning. So I have owned it for around three years. I often use it in the evening, when I do my homework. When I have free time, I also use it to relax instead of the phone and television. My laptop is a Lenovo brand. It is black and weighs more than 1 kilogram, so it is extremely portable and feather light. My laptop has a high processing speed, so it allows me to research information and download files in a matter of seconds. It has improved my learning a lot. Especially when I had to study online, the laptop helped me connect with my teachers better than the phone. So I didn\u2019t forget my origin. Moreover, I can finish school assignments and complete my club projects via laptop applications. The laptop also serves my entertainment needs. After doing my homework, I often watch movies on Netflix or Youtube and listen to music through the laptop. And to be honest, If I didn\u2019t have a laptop, my life would be more difficult and quite boring."

        "question": "Describe the first day of your school",
        "answer": "I spent many years in school, but the first day of college was truly a memorable experience for me. After a nerve-racking period of waiting for the university entrance test result, I finally became a college student and started my new higher education journey.On the first day I came to school, I found everything was so unfamiliar and a lot more crowded than my high school. It took me more than 10 minutes to find my class, and the spacious room with many other students made me feel  a bit out of place. Everyone had a strange face to me, and people did not talk much to each other. I chose a corner in the classroom to  feel more at ease. That day was just the first day of class, so the teacher gave us time to get to know each other. Moreover, she organized a wide range of activities, which catered for students with different interests, preferences and talents. Most activities involved team work, which is great for established friendships and also to develop new friendships by connecting students with funny games. Contrary to my thoughts, most of them were very friendly and outgoing. They were willing to share about themselves, and soon I  became acquainted with a lot of people. Most of our classmates came from different provinces, so we quickly understood the difficulties of living away from home. Moreover, I made friends with two lovely friends, we still stick together all the time until now. That year was completely different from the school years I had experienced, as it marked a big turning point in my life. The first day of college is truly a vivid memory, and I will always remember that remarkable milestone."

That was To he, a traditional toy originated from Xuan La village, which was a traditional craft village located only around 40 km from Hanoi centre. As I can recall, my father gave it to me after his business trip to Hanoi. I can vividly remember that To he had the shape of an animal or a fruit. It was made from a special type of rice powder with some natural colors so it was edible. The skilled craftsmen need a mixture which was easily to knead into various eye-catching shapes and stick stuck on bamboo stick. The reason why I think that To he was a special toy is that I live in the central of Vietnam and that was the first time I had seen that kind of toy. It was only ubiquitous in the North and was sold only on two special occasions: Tet holiday and Mid-autumn festival. To he was really a cultural ambassador which let me know more the beauty of Vietnam culture."

My school was surrounded by the rubber forest which brought the people fresh atmosphere and breathtaking view to see. My school had painted yellow with red roof such as a signature school figure. It was quite small with 2 floors, however, its capacity was about 800 students. In addition, students can play in an enormous playground with adequate facilities for entertaining. Therefore, I spent such a delightful childhood there. Not only did I had fun, but I was also instructed by many loving and passionate teachers. I learned from them from knowledge and life skills such as becoming warm-hearted person. I was taught that if I helped somebody, I would receive happiness. Therefore, I always believe that the more I contribute to the community, the more meaningful my life would be. Although I grew up, I could never forget what they had taught me. I am grateful for having such a memorable time in my childhood."

It was even more taller than me at that age. Its fur was brown and comfortable to touch. Its smile and plush cheeks brought out its optimistic and adorable side. The plushie appeared such as an endearing bear that every children would love to have as a friend, and I was not an exception. Moreover, the price of it was really expensive for my sisters to buy at that time when they were all students that they had to save money in order to afford it. It was their heart that made the present precious to me. Since I was young, my sisters and me lived separately from each other, therefore, the teddy bear had been my closest friend that helped me feel less lonely. Whenever I came back home from school, I put it right next to me like a study partner which motivated me to study on my own. I am sincerely grateful for receiving this present and that I appreciate my sisters being so thoughtful and loving me."

I would like to talk about the shocking news that I've heard lately, which was about an massive earthquake in Turkey. When I heard the news, I was having dinner with my family. Our family is accustomed with eating breakfast while listening to the morning news on national TV channel. The moment when the disaster in Turkey was shown on the screen, we was very shock. All the buildings collapsed and everything was in confusion. The sky turned grey as it was covered by the dust in the air. The reporter said that in Turkey, the quake sent buildings crumbling, including sections of the Gaziantep Castle, its most famous landmark and a historical symbol of the city. The death toll had reached at least 1,762 people in the country alone, with more than 12,000 others injured. Whenever I listen or read about a catastrophe, I feel so afraid of the mother nature's strength. Is there really nothing human can do to stop nature disasters? My family is deeply saddened by the earthquake's loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake, and I hope other nations will assist Turkey to overcome this difficult situation."

        "answer": "In general, people tend to care more about the events and news that happen in their residing areas and in their nations. That is simply because domestic news helps for a better survival. As we all know, due to the technology development, the pre-warning system is very advanced now, so the local news can help us to get the warning of natural hazard 10 or 20 seconds in advance, which is vital for people. Threats like floods, viral infections and any imminent threats to a specific place are known in the community communications only. For instance central region of Viet Nam is impacted by floods every year and this will be publicized heavily in that nation only. People who are alert can prepare everything to evacuate to save themselves."

This city is quite near my hometown, so we chose to drive there with out private car. When we had already travelled for nearly 2 hours, we suddenly found ourselves driving in an isolated area with no sign of houses or living creatures.  At that time, it started to get darker and colder around us, and I felt like a chill running down my spine.  My friend, the driver, also had the same feeling so he decided to speed up to across this area as soon as possible. During out way, we could hear some whispers somewhere aroud us. Though I tried my best to look for the sources of such sounds, I couldn\u2019t find any clues. Unfortunately, our car was confiscated by the police for 3 days because we drived beyond the speed limit. I tried to call my family but none of them picked up the phone. There\u2019s no other way, we made a decision on grabbing a taxi to came back my town. To be honest, after this accident, we swore to ourselves that we would never travel on that road again"

Because in her reality show she says she's so on top of the world because of that meal."

        "question": "Describe an intelligent person",
        "answer": "I'll use today's opportunity to chat about Huy, one of my all-time sharpest buddies. We used to hang out together a lot in high school until he left for college abroad. Huy was a classmate of mine in high school, and we got along great because we both loved music so much. However,  everything turned out to be quite different when it came to studying. He was regarded as the smartest student in my school Physics, whereas I was doing pretty poorly. In every exam, he came out on top, and no other student could match him. He never took longer than 3 minutes to complete a work when the teacher asked us to answer a question in physics. Huy was always well-liked by the teachers because he was quick to pick things up and had a thorough understanding of the material. Due to his intellectual prowess, he excelled not just in physics but also other science-related areas. He was also a terrific friend when I was in high school. He gave me some great advice, and I was ultimately able to improve my Physics marks as well."

I visited there with my family to relieve the stress after my entrance exam in the university. In addition, the reason why I chose that place is because I wanted to discover unusual creatures which I have never seen before. To go Safari, my family need to make a plan carefully for about two months. Vinpearl Sfr HL was so humongous with many people walking around. There were so many big trees with lots of natural shadings which cooled down the atmosphere. But the one that impressed me was the red bridge in the center of the area. We arrived in the morning and decided to wander and check out the zoo. We strolled, chatted and took photos along the way. At the end of the path, we took our seats at one of the shaded areas of the picnic ground and had lunch together. The first encounter I had with the uncommon animals such as tigers and pandas was my most memorable moment. They have different appearances,while the tiger was majestic with a huge and frightened appearance, the panda was so adorable with white and black fur.All of which made them so captivating that I couldn't take my eyes off them. All in all, the expedition turned out amazing. It's one of the most unforgettable memories in my life. The animal\u2019s impressive appearance made me realize the beauty of wilderness."

But I still remember an international news about football a few months ago. If my memory serves me right, that news just popped up on my newsfeed while I was browsing Facebook in my spare time. Because you know I would rather update news on social media than on Television because of its convenience.  That post was about one of the greatest football players of all time, Cristiano Ronaldo. He left the M.U club and moved to Al Nassar which was a small team in Saudi Arabia. At that time, I just simply thought it was fake news with wrong information to mislead readers into believing in that post like all tabloids which tend to distort the fact. To be more clear, I just followed a number of pages about football to gain a better understanding of this sport but sometimes it has misinformation. But a few days ago, I was surprised by the International news in VTV3, which is a prestigious programme in VN. It said that that trade was real. I felt a bit disappointed about that because it means that Ronaldo is quite old now and he couldn\u2019t play as well as before."

The journey, I wanted to take, was meaningful to my family as we would have a family picture at my sister\u2019s university and celebrate her being a truly \u201cadult\u201d. Therefore, the ceremony would remain incomplete if we didn\u2019t attend this ceremony on time. Besides, we also didn\u2019t want to miss any second of my sister\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime-event. So, we made all the plans in advance as we already had booked the tickets to get there and we would have about 2 hours to take a rest before the graduation ceremony. But, despite those plans in advance, the journey was delayed because there was no available coach that could take us there. And, the reason for which we couldn\u2019t get on the coach on time was that there was a traffic jam on the way back to my province. Thankfully, after about an hour of waiting, the coach finally appeared. Honestly, I felt a bit disappointed and impatient after my journey was delayed. But, even though, it was delayed, it was such a waste of time which was not only for my family but also the passengers going with us. I also felt lucky that we could still attend whole part of the graduation ceremony although we were tired a little bit because the lack of rest."

        "question": "Has transport changed in your country?",
        "answer": "Absolutely yes. There have been considerable changes to the transportation system in recent years. Just a decade ago, motorbikes were the most used form of transport in my country. Maybe because back then, locals tended to travel short distances and therefore, didn\u2019t require strong motorized vehicles.  However, nowadays, more and more people use cars as their primary transportation. In comparison to motorbikes, cars offer the ability to travel longer distances conveniently."

        "answer": "There are many interesting subjects for students but today, I will talk about my favorite subject which is Math. Math is a popular subject for everyone. Children have been learning math since they were in elementary school. Mathematics is the subject of numbers, we will have to calculate, prove theorems and find ways to solve puzzles about numbers. Math is really getting harder and harder, especially for young people, so one of them thinks math has no effect in life. But the houses we live in, the furniture we use, the money we have, it's all math. I feel happy because I like and good at this subject, because it gives me a great advantage over my classmates."

The reason why i think she is intelligent is shown in many aspects,such as her dedication, her dedication for job,her method of communication, as well. Nothing is difficult to her,such as my extremely  taxing exercises. In the first i met her, the thing i was impressed on her was her small figure body but big brain. No matter how hard my math exercises were,she was still able to seek the explanations for it. As time went by, i gradually felt her dedication with work and me,somehow she was such a kind person."

        "answer": "If you ask me who has been the greatest admiration to me, I will say my father. For me, my dad is a very delicate husband and father. He always puts his family first. I feel like he's willing to do everything to make his wife and children smile. Although he has to work super hard during the day, he always makes time for me and my mother. Besides, my dad is a very hard-working person. He gets up pretty early at about 5 A.M every morning and he normally works at least ten hours a day on your farm. You know, farming for a living in hard work, especially during summertime when the temperature can go up to nearly 40 degrees which is extremely hot. Working outdoors in these conditions is such a nightmare. Although my dad has to work super hard to support the family, I have never heard him complain about his work or things like that. All the things make me always hold my father in high esteem. And I have learned a great deal from my dad. You know, being a farmer's daughter, I understand the value of hard work. My dad is always a good role model for me. Actually, there's so many things I could talk about, but I know I don't have enough time for it."
